										<h3>We Met on Tinder</h3>
									</header>
									<p>It all started with a swipe right in August 2014! Luke messaged Grace first with a random question of working for Malaysian airlines (which Grace did not respond for a good week or so).</p>
									<p>From then we just kept speaking over text, which then led to us meeting for the first time (which Luke first cancelled for to attend Eurogamer expo as a VIP, which was too good of an opportunity to pass up). We finally met at a pub called The Garden Shed in Wimbledon. After that evening we kept meeting up and talking and the rest is history.</p>

										<h3>We Became Best Friends</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Since the first time we met we both felt comfortable in each other’s company. With both of us living in Wimbledon we saw each other nearly every day and when we didn’t see each other we were always talking on the phone. In Summer 2015 Luke left to return back to Birmingham to continue his studies, which was difficult as we were commuting back and forth, however this only made us stronger. In Summer 2016 we moved into our first flat in Redhill. Then we decided that we were ready for the next step, buying our first home in June 2018.</p>

										<h3>He Proposed ...</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The night of the proposal Luke kept annoying Grace, getting on one knee with her pandora ring whilst they were getting ready to go out. In his own words "to throw her off the scent". We went out to dinner and had a few drinks whilst waiting for the sunset.</p>
									<p>We made our way down to watch the sunset overlooking the sea, Luke set up the Go-Pro for his project of holiday video making. Whilst watching the sunset Luke got down on one knee, this time without the pandora ring, instead he had an engagement ring in a little blue box…</p>

										<h3>She Said Yes ...</h3>

									<p>... Grace didn’t say yes straight away, instead she said “you're joking?” a lot of times. Grace said yes. For the rest of that evening we pushed the boat out and drank cheap sparkling wine (part of the All-Inclusive).</p>
									<p>Now we are ready to say “I do” to each other and we would like you to be a part of our next big adventure.</p>
